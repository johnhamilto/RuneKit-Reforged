# RuneKit Reforged

**Alt1-compatible toolkit for RuneScape 3 on Linux.**

RuneKit Reforged lets you run [Alt1 toolkit](https://runeapps.org/alt1) apps (clue solvers, XP meters, AFK timers, and more) alongside the **official RuneScape 3 client** on Linux. It works by reading your game screen through screenshots — it does not modify the game client.

Reforged from the original [whs/runekit](https://github.com/whs/runekit) which was abandoned in 2021. Rebuilt with Python 3.12, Qt6, and modern dependencies for a stable experience on current Linux distros.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install system dependencies

**Ubuntu / Debian / Linux Mint:**
```sh
sudo apt install -y python3-full pipx libxcb-cursor0
```

**Fedora:**
```sh
sudo dnf install -y python3 pipx libxcb-cursor
```

**Arch Linux:**
```sh
sudo pacman -S python pipx xcb-util-cursor
```

### Step 2: Install Poetry (Python package manager)

```sh
pipx install poetry
```

If `pipx` says to add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH, do that:
```sh
# Add to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Then restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc`.

### Step 3: Clone and install RuneKit Reforged

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Jcapehart2/RuneKit-Reforged.git
cd RuneKit-Reforged
poetry install
```

This creates a virtual environment and installs all Python dependencies. It may take a minute.

### Step 4: Build resources

```sh
poetry run make dev
```

### Step 5: Launch

1. **Start RuneScape 3 first** (the official client)
2. Then run:

```sh
poetry run python main.py
```

3. A **system tray icon** will appear in your panel (top-right area)
4. **Right-click the tray icon** to see available Alt1 apps
5. On first launch, RuneKit downloads the default app list from runeapps.org

### One-Click Launcher

After initial setup, you can use the included launcher script:

```sh
./RuneKit.sh
```

This script checks for dependencies and launches RuneKit. You can double-click it in your file manager too (make sure it's marked executable with `chmod +x RuneKit.sh`).

## macOS Quick Start (Building from Source)

> **Note:** Mac support is experimental. If you just want to try it, download the [pre-built app](#download) instead.

### Step 1: Install Homebrew dependencies

```sh
brew install python@3.13 poetry
```

### Step 2: Clone and install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Jcapehart2/RuneKit-Reforged.git
cd RuneKit-Reforged
poetry install
```

### Step 3: Build resources

```sh
poetry run make dev
```

### Step 4: Launch

1. **Start RuneScape 3 first**
2. Then run:

```sh
poetry run python main.py
```

3. When prompted, grant **Accessibility** and **Screen Recording** permissions in System Settings

## Available Alt1 Apps

RuneKit automatically downloads these apps on first launch:

| App | What it does |
|---|---|
| **AFKWarden** | Alerts you when you stop gaining XP or need attention |
| **Clue Solver** | Solves clue scroll puzzles, compass clues, and map clues |
| **Stats** | Shows your skill stats and XP tracking |
| **XpMeter** | Real-time XP/hour tracking overlay |
| **RS Wiki** | Quick item/NPC/object lookup from the RS Wiki |
| **DgKey** | Dungeoneering key tracker |
| **Droplogger** | Logs your drops for tracking loot |

You can also load any custom Alt1 app by URL:
```sh
poetry run python main.py https://runeapps.org/apps/alt1/afkscape/appconfig.json
```

Or add apps through the Settings UI:

1. Right-click the system tray icon and open **Settings**
2. Go to the **Applications** tab
3. Click the **+** button
4. Paste the app's `appconfig.json` URL (e.g. `https://runeapps.org/apps/alt1/afkscape/appconfig.json`)

> **Note:** `alt1://addapp/` links (used on runeapps.org to install apps with one click) are not currently supported. If a website gives you an `alt1://` link, copy the URL from the link, strip the `alt1://addapp/` prefix, and paste the remaining `appconfig.json` URL into the Settings dialog instead.

## Built-in Clue Solver (macOS)

Alt1 apps detect the game by exact pixel matching, which breaks on Retina
displays and scaled interfaces, so the runeapps Clue Solver cannot work on
most Mac setups. RuneKit ships its own scale-tolerant solver instead: open
the clue or puzzle in game, click the tray icon, and choose **Solve Clue on
Screen**.

| Clue type | Support |
|---|---|
| Text clues (simple, cryptic, anagram, emote, action) | Solved with answer and location |
| Coordinate clues | Solved; snapped to the known dig spot with dungeon level |
| Map clues | Identified by image signature; answer and dig spot shown |
| Scan clues | Area identified; dig spots listed |
| Slide puzzles | Board read and solved; clicks numbered on the game overlay |
| Lockbox | Solved; press counts drawn on each tile |
| Towers | Solved; the completed grid is drawn into the cells |
| Compass | Needle read; walking bearing shown (no auto-triangulation yet) |
| Celtic knot | Not supported yet |

Reading text uses the macOS Vision framework, so this feature is
macOS-only. Reference data (clue database, sprites) is fetched from
runeapps.org on first use and cached locally. Solving takes a few seconds
to about a minute depending on the clue type.

## Troubleshooting

### "No game instance found"

- Make sure RuneScape 3 is **running** before you start RuneKit
- RuneKit looks for a window named "RuneScape". If your window has a different name, set:
  ```sh
  export RK_WM_APP_NAME="YourWindowName"
  ```

### Tray icon doesn't appear

- Some desktop environments hide tray icons. Check your panel settings
- On GNOME, you may need the [AppIndicator extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/)

### Black screen / overlay issues

- RuneKit requires **X11**. If you're on Wayland, switch to an X11 session at the login screen
- Or run with XWayland: `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb poetry run python main.py`

### "Failed to load module xapp-gtk3-module"

- This is a harmless warning from your desktop environment. Ignore it.

### "GBM is not supported" / Vulkan fallback

- This is normal — Qt WebEngine falls back to Vulkan rendering. Everything works fine.

## Bug Reports

If something isn't working, please open a GitHub Issue and **include your log file**.

RuneKit automatically saves logs to:

```
~/.config/cupco.de/RuneKit/logs/runekit.log
```

Logs rotate automatically (3 files, 1MB each) so they won't fill your disk.

**To submit a bug report:**

1. Reproduce the issue
2. Find your log file (see path above)
3. Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Jcapehart2/RuneKit-Reforged/issues/new) with:
   - What you were doing when it broke
   - Your distro and desktop environment (e.g., "Ubuntu 24.04, GNOME on X11")
   - Attach or paste your `runekit.log` file

---

## Settings

Open the settings dialog:
```sh
poetry run python main.py settings
```

---

## Debugging

Enable the Chromium remote debugger:
```sh
poetry run python main.py --remote-debugging-port=9222
```
Then open `chrome://inspect` in Chrome/Chromium to debug Alt1 apps.

---

## Building an AppImage

```sh
poetry run make dist/RuneKit.AppImage
```

---

## macOS Support (Experimental)

The codebase includes macOS support inherited from the original RuneKit project, but it has **not been tested** since the Qt6 migration. Things may be broken.

- The maintainer does not have a Mac, so issues can't be diagnosed without your help
- If something doesn't work, please [open a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Jcapehart2/RuneKit-Reforged/issues/new) with details about what happened and your macOS version
- Contributions and pull requests for macOS fixes are very welcome

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11–3.14** with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for dependency management
- **PySide6 / Qt6** for the UI, web engine, and overlay system
- **OpenCV** and **Pillow** for image processing (screen capture)
- **xcffib** for X11 window detection
